# Practicum-Project: 
### Main Greenhouse Gas Contributors and Future Emission Predictions
 My goal in this practicum project is to determine the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and make future emission predictions. Climate change is a very real crisis we are facing today and human emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gases are a primary driver of climate change. I would like to dig deeper into this and determine what specifically is playing a role in these increased emissions and predict how these rates will change in years to come.
